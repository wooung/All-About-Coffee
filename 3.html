  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewed_coffee" target="_blank" title="about Hand Drip">Hand Drip</a>
  is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans,
  then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this,
  including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for
  the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee,
  filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee.
  Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds,
  and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter,
  while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.
