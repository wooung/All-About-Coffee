  (also known as Americano or American; Italian pronunciation: [kafˈfɛ ameriˈkaːno];
   Spanish: café americano, literally American coffee) is a type of coffee drink
   prepared by diluting an espresso with hot water, giving it a similar strength to,
   but different flavor from, traditionally brewed coffee. Its strength varies
   with the number of shots of espresso and amount of water added. The name is also
  spelled with varying capitalization and use of diacritics: e.g., café americano.
