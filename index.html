    is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of
    berries from certain flowering plants in the Coffea genus. From the coffee fruit,
    the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green coffee.
    The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable
    product: roasted coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped
    in hot water before being filtered out, producing a cup of coffee.
